# Old Repository for Vegetariano! app
Final Project App for Minor Programming at the Universtiy of Amsterdam

## New Repository
https://github.com/MarritL/MarritLeenstrapset62.git

## Reason for new repository
I worked on a major bug in my app and tried different things to fix this problem: for example save a value in SharedPreferences so that on launch I can check if it is the first launch or not. However, this wasn't working and also other things started to not work anymore (when navigating to User-tab, the app didn't respond anymore without any errors). Therefor I tried to set it back to the previous version with version control. However, then the app didn't recognize the standard build in functions like 'findViewById()' or 'setContentView()'.
To be able to continue with my project I had to copy all the files one by one to a new project and repository (from MarritLeenstra-pset6-1 to MarritLeenstrapset62). See link in New Repository paragraph.

## Introduction Vegetariano!
Vegetariano! is a mobile application designed for new vegetarians. It can be difficult to start and commit to a vegetarian diet after many meat-eating years. You don't know what to cook and how to cook it and after a while, you might start to miss your hamburgers and chickenwings. Vegetariano! is helping users in this early stage of their vegetarianism by supplying them daily with new recipes. As well it helps keep users commited by keeping track of the user's runstreak and total vegetarian days. With this is calculates how many animals are saved and how many CO2-emision is avoided by the user. Users can furthermore relate to the Vegetariano! community and check how many people ate vegetarian at a day, as well as how many animal kills and CO2-emission is avoided by the community as a whole.
